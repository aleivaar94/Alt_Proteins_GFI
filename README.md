# State of the alternative protein industry in 2023

Despite previous signs of maturation in the alternative protein industry such as lower production costs and faster scalability, recent data indicates a 21% decrease in sales for the year ending in July 2023. This is mainly due to two reasons:
 
 - **Cost:** Current inflation and volatile markets make alternative proteins more expensive than conventional meat.

 - **Consumer Perception:** Many consumers sought alternative proteins for perceived health benefits, but unfamiliar and complex ingredient labels have led to skepticism. As a result, this category is now perceived as highly processed and unhealthy.

 This project analyses the alternative protein company database from the Good Food Institute (GFI) to describe the current state of alternative protein market.
